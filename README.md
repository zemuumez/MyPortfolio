# My Portfolio

This project has been migrated from a static HTML/CSS site to a modern React application built with **TypeScript** and **Tailwind CSS**. All legacy files are kept inside the `legacy/` folder for reference.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

## Structure

- `src/assets` – images and fonts
- `src/components` – reusable React components
- `src/data` – project and skill data
- `legacy` – original HTML, CSS and JS
